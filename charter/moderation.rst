==================
Content Moderation
==================

Recovery deals with sick people, and naturally that will occasionally
expose us to unpleasant, even malicious activities.  While we intend
to profer all available tolerances, there are practical limits to such
an approach.  We attempt to deal with the subject of moderating volation
of those limits here.

Entitlement
===========

.. warning::

   Instead of complaining that moderation is unfair or somehow a violation
   itself, please seek clarity by reading this section.

No one is entitled to any use of the site, chat network, or any of their
related resources.  Participation is a privilege, and it may be revoked
for any reason at any time.

Free Speech
-----------

There is no "free speech" or "first ammendment" case on the site:

*  Harmful speech is not protected
*  Protections are against *government* interference
*  National laws are not universal, the site is not constrained to any
   particular nation

See `this accessible free speech primer`_ for more information.

Twelve Step Traditions
----------------------

Though it may host "12 step" meetings, and 12-step "fellowship" may take
place on the site, there is no "3rd tradition" or other case:

*  There is no association between the site and any other 12-step group
   or organization, thus the traditions are not intended to apply
*  The "3rd tradition" refers to identification as a member of the
   fellowship at large, and does not dictate a right to participate in a
   particular way in a particular meeting.  You are welcome to call
   yourself a member, or yourselves a group, of your respective
   fellowship, even if you are not welcome to use this site.
*  The "4th tradition" is to respect the autonomy of every group,
   respecting each groups' right to self-govern, which includes moderation
*  Any group that hosts a meeting on the network is welcome to make
   its decisions independent of the network or other groups, including a
   decision to host their meetings elsewhere.
*  The traditions are guiding principles, not binding rules or laws

The seminal, or perhaps _traditional_\, `traditions are detailed here`_.

Ban Policy
==========

Bannable Offenses
-----------------

Offenses that may result in a ban include but are not limited to:

*  Harrassment
*  Threats
*  Programmatic or automated activity (bots, auto-responders, etc.)
*  Using nicknames as messages
*  Use of offensive language, as determined by moderators, which may or
   may not include the opinion of the audience of the offending message
   (i.e. non-moderator chatters other than the author of the language
   in question)
*  Attempts to circumvent access controls
*  Attempts to disrupt site operation or services
*  Disproportionate consumption of resources (e.g. "crowding out the conversation")
*  Misuse of features

Qualified determination of whether an offense warrants a ban is entirely
at the discretion of moderators.  Moderators are under no obligation to
recognize or enforce any bans.

Scope
-----

*  Channel operators reserve the exclusive right to manage bans that
   apply to their own channels
*  Network operators reserve the right to enforce channel bans at the
   network level.  Abuse in a specific channel may result in a ban from
   the entire network
*  Network operators reserve the right to prohibt or refuse to restrict
   private messages on either an individual or universal basis
*  Providers of various infrastructure services the site employs
   (Internet, "cloud", hosting, etc.) reserve the right to moderate
   the site's usage of their resources at the infrastructure level
   accordingly.

Duration
--------

*  The length of bans is variable, and escalates in proportion to the
   nature of the offense
*  The length of a particular ban may change while that ban is in effect
*  Actions to circumvent a ban, regardless of whether they are successful,
   will escalate the ban
*  Bans may be enforced for whatever period of time any sufficiently
   privileged moderator or operator deems appropriate

Authority
---------

The authority of this policy is the prerogative of the owner(s) of the
discrete resources on which the site is built (that is, whatever entity
is funding and operating the domain registration and networked resources)

Remonstration
=============

In the case of access or content that is inappropriately restricted,
remonstration may be submitted via e-mail to site operators or the
appropriate domain registrant contact.  In order to be considered,
appeals must include a clear and concise justification of how the
moderated activity contributes to the sites purpose without violating
the devaluing the site for its other users.
