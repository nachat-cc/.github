Content Moderation

Entitlement
===========

.. warning::

   Instead of complaining that moderation is unfair or somehow a violation
   itself, please seek clarity by reading this section.

No one is entitled to any use of the site, chat network, or any of their
related resources.  Participation is a privilege, and it may be revoked
for any reason at any time.

Free Speech
-----------

There is no "free speech" or "first ammendment" case on the site:

*  Harmful speech is not protected
*  Protections are against *government* interference
*  National laws are not universal, the site is not constrained to any
   particular nation

See `this accessible free speech primer`_ for more information.

Twelve Step Traditions
----------------------

Though it may host "12 step" meetings, and 12-step "fellowship" may take
place on the site, there is no "3rd tradition" or other case:

*  There is no association between the site and any other 12-step group
   or organization, thus the traditions are not intended to apply
*  The "3rd tradition" refers to identification as a member of the
   fellowship at large, and does not dictate a right to participate in a
   particular way in a particular meeting.  You are welcome to call
   yourself a member, or yourselves a group, of your respective
   fellowship, even if you are not welcome to use this site.
*  The "4th tradition" is to respect the autonomy of every group,
   respecting each groups' right to self-govern, which includes moderation
*  Any group that hosts a meeting on the network is welcome to make
   its decisions independent of the network or other groups, including a
   decision to host their meetings elsewhere.
*  The traditions are guiding principles, not binding rules or laws

The seminal, or perhaps _traditional_\, `traditions are detailed here`_.
