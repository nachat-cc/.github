# NAChat dot NET Chat Club

## About

"<span class="title-ref">NAChat dot NET</span>" is the product of peer
support efforts by and for individuals dealing with their own substance
abuse and mental health disorders, and their associated issues. We are a
group of friends and volunteers who regularly contribute our time,
talents and resources to promoting recovery. This is primarily done
through a text-based, web-accessible chat network where we support
eachother in real time with regular companionship. If you think you have
a problem with substance abuse and would like to stop using drugs, check
out <https://www.nachat.net> or <ircs://sueserv.nachat.net>.

## NAChat.net

Accessible at <https://www.nachat.net>, this is our flagship site,
descended from years of on-line interaction. It is dedicated to a group
that regularly holds [Narcotics Anonymous](https://na.org) member
meetings.

## GitHub

Our presence on GitHub is an effort to advance the logistics of
collaborating on technical resources, such as site content, server
infrastructure, chat automations, and everyday operations.

By using the de-facto standard software product platform, our goal is to
empower members to make contributions as safely and as automatically as
reasonably possible, regardless of their technical abilities and
privileges. Most notably, we leverage the following features to do this:

  - Role-based access control (RBAC) through "Teams"
  - Articulating, assigning and tracking work through "Issues" and
    "Projects"
  - Safely incorporating contributions through trusted "Reviews" of
    "Pull Requests" from "Forks"
  - Integrated testing and deployment through "Actions"

The resources here should make development of the network more robust,
and enable the scaling or duplication of the network. Our intention is
to reveal these repositories as soon as we are comfortable in the safety
of doing so.
